# ui:cn

 
A ViewHelper that mimics the behavior of the popular `clsx` library for conditional class name merging.
It allows you to combine static class names with conditional ones based on the truthiness of values.

It also helps you with whitespace management by filtering out empty or whitespace-only class names 
and makes it possible to declare your class in multiple lines, which is especially useful in combination with Tailwind CSS.

## Examples

A common pattern you maybe already needed to use is something like this:
```html
<div class="my-class{f:if(condition: someCondition, then: ' my-other-class')}">
```
This can get unwieldy when you have multiple conditional classes. Instead, you can use this ViewHelper:
```html
<div class="{ui:cn(value: 'my-class', when: { 'my-other-class': someCondition})}">
```

In context of components you will do something like this:
```html
<div class="{ui:cn(value: 'my-class-1 my-class-2 {class}')}">
```
This will render the classes and if the component consumer passes a `class` prop, it will be appended.
