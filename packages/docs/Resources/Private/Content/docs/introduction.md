# Introduction

Fluid UI is a headless component library for TYPO3 that allows developers to create flexible and reusable UI components using the Fluid templating engine. It promotes a composable approach to building user interfaces, making it easier to manage and maintain complex layouts.

It provides fully accessible and customizable primitives thanks to [Zag JS](https://zagjs.com/) as barebones.

## Motivation

Fluid UI was created because there was no elegant solution for building robust, composable components in Fluid. The composition approach is inspired by the broader web ecosystem, particularly [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives).

We also aimed to provide a seamless experience while solving the challenge of connecting DOM nodes between client and server-rendered markup.
